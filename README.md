TTS (Text To Speech) live.

Server loading model and other processer can call it to generate voice.

I think it will be cool to give any application permissions to do so.

Imagine your system with voice assistance, but it can interact with your system apps. Send notifications and receive commands. And your can choose or generate voices!

And integration is easy, just call the process and audio will play automatically.

## Demo

Imaging you compiling large project and want to receive notification when it's done.

You need to have `make` and `python3.11` intalled on your machine.

```bash
./demo.sh
```
